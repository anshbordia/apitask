# Api Task

This repositiory contains code that retrieves data from an API in the desired format as requested in the coding task (race type, race number, race name, venue and the race start time and sorted by start time).

The data (dummy data on races) can be found in data.csv.

To run the code:

1) Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt (Tested on Python 3.7)
2) Run all the code lines on Jupyter Notebook. If you don't have Jupyter Notebooks installed, the code from the file on the repo can be copy pasted into a Python file.
3) Results can be checked using either a) entering address:port/races in the browser or b) entering address:port/races on Postman and sending a GET request. Screenshots of the results on Postman can be seen in the pdf file.

Please let me know if there are any questions.
